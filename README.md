# Whats Scoop?
Scoop is a command-line package manager for Windows that allows you to install various software packages from the command line. It's similar to package managers like apt-get or Homebrew, but it's designed specifically for Windows.

Scoop is built with PowerShell and uses PowerShell cmdlets to install and manage software packages. It installs packages into user's home directory by default, rather than into the system directories, which allows for easy management of multiple versions of the same package. Additionally, it allows for easy uninstallation of packages and updating installed packages.
